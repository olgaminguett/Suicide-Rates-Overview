# Suicide Rates Overview from 1985 to 2016
Udacity Data Scientist Nano Degree Capstone Project

## Motivation
This project for the Udacity Data Scientist Nano Degree, It is the Capstone project.
I will be looking at the interactions between suicide rate and certain factor such as HDI and GDP, to 
answer the question: How many people commit suicide per population?

## Data
A dataset that consists on 27820 data points per 12 columns that compares socio-economic info with suicide rates by year and

  - 35-54 Years
  - 55-74 Years
  - 75+ Years
- SuicidesNo: Number of suicides per country, year, sex and age group.
- Population: 
- Suicides100kPop: Suicide Number every 100k that belongs to certain age group
- CountryYear: Concat of country and Year 
- HDIForYear: Human Development Index for year 
- GDPForYear$: Gross Domestic Product per year 
- GDPPerCapita$: Gross Domestic Product per capita
- Generation:
  - G.I. Generation - born between 1900 - 1920
